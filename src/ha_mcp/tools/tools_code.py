"""
Sandboxed custom tool for Home Assistant MCP Server.

Provides an "escape hatch" (ha_manage_custom_tool) that lets LLMs write and run
custom Python code when no existing tool covers the request, with optional
save/reuse and listing of saved tools.  Code runs in pydantic-monty — a
Rust-based sandboxed Python interpreter with no filesystem or arbitrary
network access. Sandbox code can talk to Home Assistant through five external
functions: ``api_get`` and ``api_post`` for the REST API,
``ws_send`` for WebSocket commands, ``call_tool`` for delegating to other
registered MCP tools, and ``delete_saved_tool`` for removing a previously
saved custom tool. ``api_get``/``api_post`` reject absolute URLs so the HA
bearer token cannot be redirected off-instance.

Saved tools persist to disk when ``CODE_MODE_SAVED_TOOLS_PATH`` is set (the
addon sets this by default), letting users build their own "MCP within an
MCP" — a personal library of one-off tools that survives restarts.

**Requires** ``ENABLE_CODE_MODE=true`` (disabled by default).

# subsequent ``save_as`` / ``delete_saved_tool``. Per-call request
# scope wouldn't work because ``run_saved`` would never see prior

# boundary.

        ⚠️  **LAST RESORT** — search for existing tools first.

        **Modes** (mutually exclusive):
        - Provide ``code`` + ``justification`` to execute custom code
        - Set ``run_saved`` to re-run a previously saved tool by name
        - Set ``list_saved=True`` to list all saved tools

        **Available functions in sandbox:**
        - ``api_get(endpoint)`` — GET request to HA REST API
        - ``api_post(endpoint, data)`` — POST request to HA REST API
        - ``ws_send(message)`` — send a HA WebSocket command (e.g. registry
          lookups, ``render_template``, dashboard ops). ``message`` must include
          a ``"type"`` field; the MCP server adds ``id`` and handles auth.
        - ``call_tool(name, args)`` — call a registered MCP tool
        - ``delete_saved_tool(name)`` — remove a previously saved custom
          tool by name. Returns ``{"deleted": True, "name": name}`` or
          ``{"error": ...}``.

        Use ``api_get``/``api_post`` for REST operations not covered by existing
        tools.  Use ``ws_send`` when the operation is only available over the
        Home Assistant WebSocket API (most registry CRUD, template rendering,
        and Lovelace operations).  Use ``call_tool`` when an existing tool
        already does what you need. Use ``delete_saved_tool`` to clean up
        saved tools you no longer need.

        Saved tools persist across server restarts when
        ``CODE_MODE_SAVED_TOOLS_PATH`` is set (the addon sets this by
        default to ``/data/saved_tools.json``).

        Example — check repairs (no built-in tool for this):
        ```python
        repairs = await api_get("/repairs/issues")
        repairs
        ```

        Example — list areas via WebSocket:
        ```python
        result = await ws_send({"type": "config/area_registry/list"})
        result.get("result", [])
        ```

        Example — chain existing tools:
        ```python
        result = await call_tool("ha_search_entities", {"query": "light", "limit": 5})
        data = result.get("data", result)
        lights = data.get("results", [])
        for e in lights:
            await call_tool("ha_call_service", {
                "domain": "light", "service": "turn_off",
                "entity_id": e["entity_id"]})
        {"turned_off": len(lights)}
        ```

        Example — delete an obsolete saved tool:
        ```python
        delete_saved_tool("old_movie_mode")
        ```

        Args:
            code: Python code to execute.  Last expression is the return value.
            justification: Why no existing tool works (required with code).
            save_as: Save the tool under this name for reuse (alphanumeric/underscores, max 64 chars).
            run_saved: Name of a previously saved tool to re-run.
            list_saved: Set True to list all saved tools.
