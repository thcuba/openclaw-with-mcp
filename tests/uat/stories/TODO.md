# Story Backlog

Weighted backlog of user acceptance stories. Weight = importance (1-5).
Stories with weight >= 4 are candidates for the core set.
Lower-weight stories are good for comprehensive coverage.

## Results Tracking

Results are appended to a JSONL file after each run. Each line records one story result:

```jsonl
{"sha":"8b521d4","version":"v6.6.1","branch":"v6.6.1","timestamp":"2026-02-13T10:00:00+00:00","agent":"gemini","story":"s01","category":"automation","weight":5,"passed":true,"test_duration_ms":45000,"total_duration_ms":62000,"tool_calls":5,"tool_failures":0,"turns":3,"session_file":"/home/user/.gemini/tmp/.../session-*.json","tokens_input":145000,"tokens_output":650,"tokens_cached":110000,"tokens_thoughts":550}
```

- `sha`: exact commit for reproducibility
- `version`: human-readable from `git describe --tags` (e.g., `v6.6.1` or `v6.6.1-5-gabc1234`)
- `branch`: the `--branch` flag value (tag/branch installed via uvx), or `null` for local code
- `test_duration_ms`: duration of the test phase only
- `total_duration_ms`: includes setup + test (total wall time)
- `session_file`: path to agent session file (for white-box analysis)
- `tokens_input` / `tokens_output` / `tokens_cached` / `tokens_thoughts`: token usage from session file
- **Billable tokens** = `tokens_input - tokens_cached + tokens_output + tokens_thoughts` (cached tokens are free)

**Local runs:** `local/uat-results.jsonl` (gitignored)
**Future CI:** Orphan branch `uat-results` with `history.jsonl`

**Running with results tracking:**
```bash
# Run against current local code
python tests/uat/stories/run_story.py --all --agents gemini

# Run against a specific release tag
python tests/uat/stories/run_story.py --all --agents gemini --branch v6.6.1

# Custom results file location
python tests/uat/stories/run_story.py --all --agents gemini --results-file /tmp/results.jsonl
```

**Querying results:**
```bash
# All results for a specific version
jq 'select(.branch == "v6.6.1")' local/uat-results.jsonl

# Pass rate by story
jq -s 'group_by(.story) | .[] | {story: .[0].story, pass_rate: ([.[] | select(.passed)] | length) / length}' local/uat-results.jsonl

# Compare two runs
diff <(jq -s 'sort_by(.story) | .[] | {s:.story,p:.passed}' run1.jsonl) <(jq -s 'sort_by(.story) | .[] | {s:.story,p:.passed}' run2.jsonl)
```
